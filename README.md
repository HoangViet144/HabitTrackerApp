## Abstraction

People usually feel lazy when they don't have some deadlines or someone urges them . Moreover, they are likely to want to share what they have done through a period of time as proud achivements .

Therefore, it is necessary to have an app which can not only push them little pressure but also record their effort. As a result, our app - Habit Tracker App is a perfectly suitable application for them. 

With our app, users can create a habit goal to achieve with a due date, edit them, delete them and also see list of goals they have finished. Moreover, our app save all data on remote storage which helps them to get old data when they use new device or reinstall application.

## Project's insight

Habit Tracker App consist of 3 main pages:

-Login: users of our app can register an account for themselves which means their input goals will be saved in the firebase database.

-Dashboard: A list of user's active goals (information such as goal's description, due date, progress, priority and progress update are provided) which can be seen as a reminder that not only helps our users keeping track of their progress but also gives them motivation to complete thier planned tasks.

* Due date, progess and priority will provide users with sufficient information (which goal is the most vital, how much time remain for me to finish my task,...) from which a better management of goals, timetable, plans will be achieved.

-Create new goal: Allow users to set new tasks (description, due date, progress, priority can be edited in this page giving users the freefdom to classify the new tasks for better understanding of what they need to achieve).

## Project's potential for future development

1) Filtering goals based on available fields: provide better management by listing the goals in order of progress, duedate... or by grouping similar tasks together.
2) A vibrant achievement page: users will be given a digital plot of land of their own, for each goals fullfilled more construction will be built on this plot of land. This will provide users with more motivation to achieve their targets, also sharing your plot of land on social media is allowed.
